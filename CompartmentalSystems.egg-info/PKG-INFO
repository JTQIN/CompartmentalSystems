Description: This is a Python package for compartmental systems.
        
        Python package to deal with compartmental models. These models can
        be both nonlinear and nonautonomous. Consequently, this package can be seen
        as an extension of [LAPM](https://github.com/goujou/LAPM) which deals
        with linear autonomous models.
        While [LAPM](https://github.com/goujou/LAPM) also allows explicit symbolic compuations of age distributions 
        in compartmental systems, this package is mostly concerned with numerical
        computations of
        
        * age
        
            * compartmental age densities
            * system age densities
            * compartmental age mean and higher order moments
            * system age mean and higher order moments
            * compartmental age quantiles
            * system age quantiles
        
        * transit time
        
            * forward and backward transit time densities
            * backward transit time mean and higher order moments
            * forward and backward transit time quantiles
