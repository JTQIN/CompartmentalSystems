Description: # CompartmentalSystem: A Python3 package for the analysis of compartmental systems
        
        These systems can be both nonlinear and nonautonomous. Consequently, this package can be seen
        as an extension of [LAPM](https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/LAPM) which deals
        with linear autonomous models.
        While [LAPM](https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/LAPM) also allows explicit symbolic compuations of age distributions 
        in compartmental systems, this package is mostly concerned with numerical
        computations of
        
        * Age
        
            * compartmental age densities
            * system age densities
            * compartmental age mean and higher order moments
            * system age mean and higher order moments
            * compartmental age quantiles
            * system age quantiles
        
        * Transit time
        
            * forward and backward transit time densities
            * backward transit time mean and higher order moments
            * forward and backward transit time quantiles

        Installation simply via the install script `install.sh`.
        Use either `develop` or `install` as additional parameter, it will be 
        passed to the `python3 setup.py` call.
        
        Be sure to have [LAPM](https://github.com/MPIBPG-TEE/LAPM) installed.
        Further required packages can be found in the install script.
