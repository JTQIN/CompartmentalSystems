# Transit-time and age distributions for nonlinear and time-dependent compartmental systems

(H. Metzler, M. MÃ¼ller, C. A. Sierra)

This folder is a subfolder of the Python package CompartmentalSystems.
It contains a jupiter notebook which reproduces the numerical example from the paper and extends on it.


## Files

* `emissions.csv`: The emission data from RCP/ECP8.5
* `notebook.html`: Compiled HTML version of the IPython notebook
* `notebook.ipynb`: IPython notebook (Jupyter)

## Subfolders

* `output_data_v1`: Output data of the nonlinear version
* `outout_data_v2`: Output data of the linear version

## Links

- [In-GitHub preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/CompartmentalSystems/blob/master/notebooks/PNAS/notebook.html) (with small display issues)

## Notes

* If you cannot see the interactive 3D figures, hover with the mouse over the large white areas and an interactive panel should apper. Click on _orbital rotation_ (for example) and the figure should load.
* Downloading the HTML file and viewing it offline might solve the display problms of the In-GitHub preview.
